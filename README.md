## TODO

    [] bit arrays
    [x] change everything to conv3d
    [x] change everything to conv2d (3d was incorrect)
    [x] test
    [x] reduce dimensionality 8 values can be one bit.
    [x] test with new dimensionality.
    [x] add test validation.

    [x] plots
    <!-- [] reduce 68 to 64 --> 
    [x] padding -> valid
    [x] train with full data
    [x] go back bits
    [x] plot to compare midi plots
    

    [] loss of valid with 01
    [] hyperparameters
    [x] fix array 2 midi function
